# Game of Sticks

Start the game from the begin_sticks_game.py file.
It will then ask if you'd like to play a 2-player game, 1-player against AI, or 1-player against a trained AI.
Once you've made your choice it will begin the corresponding game and you are able to play as many times as you'd like.
